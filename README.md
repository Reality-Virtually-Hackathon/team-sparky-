Reality Virtually Hackathon at MIT: Oct. 06-09, 2017

Project concept:

Smartphone Augmented Reality application on Android designed to help children facing long-term hospitalization and/or bed rest in impersonal, sterilized environments, supplement their potentially inadequate interaction with friends, family, and medical professionals with a friendly AR animal connected with a physical toy of similar appearance. This project seeks to provide children facing challenging, frightening, and potentially isolating experiences process their emotions and have a sense of warmth both from the physical toy as well as the friendly AR projection in cold, ascetic environments. Rather than providing pure escapism which could have the negative side effect of a jarring return to reality, this model helps children assuage boredom, process their loneliness, curiosity, and anxiety in healthy ways, and have social interaction when the alternative would be something detached like viewing a television. Social interaction and comforting physical contact have demonstrable benefits in terms of mental and physical health outcomes for hospital patients, so providing unique improvements to the patient experience for children facing disheartening health crises is an amazing potential use case for AR that fills a continuing gap in care options.
